> Parallel Claude Code agent orchestration powered by git worktrees

funny is a web UI for orchestrating multiple [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) agents in parallel. It uses git worktrees to let each agent work on its own branch simultaneously without conflicts. Think of it as a Codex App clone powered by the [Claude Agent SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk) (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`).

## Features

- **Parallel agent execution** — Run multiple Claude Code agents simultaneously on different branches
- **Git worktree isolation** — Each agent gets its own isolated working directory
- **Real-time monitoring** — WebSocket-based live updates for all agent activities
- **Git integration** — Built-in diff viewer, staging, commits, and PR creation
- **Kanban board** — Drag-and-drop task management with columns (backlog, in progress, review, done, archived)
- **Search** — Find threads by title, branch name, status, or message content with real-time filtering
- **Analytics dashboard** — Track task creation, completion rates, stage distribution, and cost metrics over time
- **MCP support** — Model Context Protocol integration
- **Automation scheduling** — Cron-based recurring tasks
- **Mobile support** — Responsive mobile view with touch-friendly navigation for on-the-go monitoring

## Installation

### Quick Start (bunx)

No installation needed! Run directly with:

```bash
bunx @ironmussa/funny@lastest
```

The app will start and open at `http://localhost:3001`

### Global Installation

```bash
bun install -g @ironmussa/funny
funny
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ironmussa/funny.git
cd funny
bun install
bun run build
bun start
```

## Requirements

- **Bun** >= 1.0.0 (install from [bun.sh](https://bun.sh))
- **Claude CLI** installed and authenticated ([claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code))
- **Git** installed and configured

## Usage

funny has two modes: **local** (solo, everything on your machine) and **team** (multiple users collaborating via a central server).

### Local Mode (Single User)

This is the default. Everything runs on your machine — UI, database, git operations, and Claude agents.

```bash
# Quick start (no installation)
bunx @ironmussa/funny@latest

# Or if installed globally
funny

# Custom port
funny --port 8080

# Show all options
funny --help
```

Open `http://localhost:3001` in your browser. That's it.

### Team Mode (Multiple Users)

Team mode lets multiple users collaborate on shared projects. It requires two components:

1. **Central server** (`funny-server`) — Runs on a shared machine. Manages users, projects, memberships, and coordinates runners.
2. **Local runner** (`funny --team <url>`) — Each team member runs funny locally and connects to the central server.

#### Step 1: Start the central server

On a shared machine (or your own machine if your team is on the same network):

```bash
# Install
bun install -g @ironmussa/funny

# Start the central server
funny-server --port 3002
```

On first start, a default admin account is created:
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin`

The admin can create additional user accounts from the central server's API.

#### Step 2: Each team member connects

Each team member runs funny locally with the `--team` and `--token` flags:

```bash
funny --team http://<central-server-ip>:3002 --token <invite-token>
```

The invite token is generated from the central server's **Settings > Runners** page. Copy the install command and run it — it works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

On first run, the `--team` and `--token` values are **automatically saved** to `~/.funny/.env`, so subsequent runs only need:

```bash
funny
```

This starts the full funny app locally (UI, git, agents) **and** connects to the central server to:
- Authenticate and see team projects
- Sync thread state across the team
- Receive dispatched tasks from the central server

Each member's git operations and Claude agents run **on their own machine**, in their own local repos. The central server only coordinates — it never touches your filesystem.

#### Team mode architecture

```
Team member A                    Team member B

### CLI Options

**funny** (local app)

| Option                | Description                              | Default     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `-p, --port <port>`   | Server port                              | `3001`      |
| `-h, --host <host>`   | Server host                              | `127.0.0.1` |
| `--auth-mode <mode>`  | Authentication mode: `local` or `multi`  | `local`     |
| `--team <url>`        | Connect to a central team server         | -           |
| `--token <token>`     | Runner invite token for team registration | -          |
| `--help`              | Show help message                        | -           |

**funny-server** (team coordination server)

| Option                | Description                              | Default     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `-p, --port <port>`   | Server port                              | `3002`      |
| `-h, --host <host>`   | Server host                              | `0.0.0.0`   |
| `--help`              | Show help message                        | -           |

### Persistent Configuration

When you pass `--team` or `--token` via the CLI, the values are automatically saved to `~/.funny/.env`. On subsequent runs, funny loads this file so you don't need to repeat the flags.

```bash
# First time — pass the full connection info
funny --team http://192.168.1.10:3002 --token utkn_xxx

# Every subsequent run — just this
funny
```

**Precedence order:** CLI flags > shell environment variables > saved `~/.funny/.env`

To change the server, simply pass `--team` again with a new URL — the saved config is updated automatically. The `.env` file is created with restricted permissions (`0600`) since it contains tokens.

### Environment Variables

| Variable                 | Description                           | Default         | Used by          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| `PORT`                   | Server port                           | `3001` / `3002` | both             |
| `HOST`                   | Server hostname                       | `127.0.0.1`     | both             |
| `AUTH_MODE`              | Authentication mode (`local`/`multi`) | `local`         | funny            |

## Kanban Board

Threads can be visualized and managed as a Kanban board with five columns:

- **Backlog** — Tasks waiting to be started
- **In Progress** — Tasks currently being worked on
- **Review** — Tasks ready for code review
- **Done** — Completed tasks
- **Archived** — Archived tasks

Drag and drop cards between columns to update their stage. Cards show thread status, git sync state, cost, and time since last update. Pinned threads appear first in each column. You can create new threads directly from the board and switch between list and board views.

## Search & Filtering

Find threads quickly using the search bar. Search matches against:

- **Thread title**
- **Branch name**
- **Thread status**
- **Message content** (server-side full-text search with content snippets)

Results highlight matching text. Combine search with filters for status, git state, and mode to narrow results further. Filters sync to URL query parameters so you can share filtered views.

## Analytics

The analytics dashboard provides an overview of task activity and costs:

- **Metric cards** — Tasks created, completed, moved to review/done/archived, and total cost
- **Stage distribution chart** — Pie chart showing current distribution of threads across stages
- **Timeline chart** — Bar chart showing task activity over time, grouped by day/week/month/year

Filter analytics by project and time range (day, week, month, or all-time).

## Mobile Support

funny includes a dedicated mobile view that automatically activates on screens narrower than 768px. The mobile interface provides a streamlined, touch-friendly experience for monitoring and interacting with your agents on the go.

**Mobile features:**

- **Stack-based navigation** — Projects → Threads → Chat, with back buttons for easy navigation
- **Full chat interaction** — Send messages, view agent responses, approve/reject tool calls, and monitor running agents
- **Thread management** — Create new threads with model and mode selection directly from your phone
- **Status monitoring** — Real-time status badges and agent activity indicators
- **Auto-scrolling** — Smart scroll behavior that follows new messages while preserving your scroll position

The sidebar automatically converts to a slide-out drawer on mobile via the shadcn/ui Sheet component.

## Data Storage

**funny** (local app) stores data in:

```
~/.funny/
├── .env              # Saved CLI config (--team, --token) — auto-generated
├── data.db           # SQLite database (projects, threads, messages)
├── auth-token        # Bearer token for local auth
├── auth-secret       # Session secret (multi-user mode)
└── encryption.key    # AES-256-GCM key for GitHub token encryption
```

**funny-server** (team server) stores data separately in:

```
~/.funny-central/
├── central.db        # SQLite database (users, projects, memberships, runners)
├── auth-secret       # Session secret
└── encryption.key    # AES-256-GCM key for token encryption
```

## Git Worktrees

Worktrees are created in `.funny-worktrees/` adjacent to your project:

```
/your-project/
├── .git/
├── src/
└── ...

/your-project-worktrees/
├── feature-branch-1/
├── feature-branch-2/
└── ...
```

Each worktree is an isolated working directory allowing parallel agent work without conflicts.

## Chrome Extension

The `packages/chrome-extension` package contains a Chrome extension for selecting and annotating UI elements, then sending them to Funny for AI-powered analysis and fixes.

### Building the Extension

```bash
# Install dependencies (from the repo root)
bun install

# Build the extension
cd packages/chrome-extension
bun run build
```

This compiles the TypeScript source files (`src/`) into JavaScript files in the package root, ready for Chrome to load.

### Loading in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `packages/chrome-extension` folder
5. The extension icon should appear in your toolbar

### Development (watch mode)

```bash
cd packages/chrome-extension
bun run watch
```

This watches for changes in `src/` and rebuilds automatically. After each rebuild, click the reload button on `chrome://extensions` to pick up the changes.
